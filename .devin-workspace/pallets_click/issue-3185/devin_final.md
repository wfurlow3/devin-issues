REASON: no permission

The fork failed with HTTP 403: "Resource not accessible by integration". I don't have permission to fork the pallets/click repository to create a PR.

Note: The fix for issue #3185 (flag_value not working in 8.3.1) is already present in the stable branch and will be included in the next release (8.3.2). The fix was merged in commits 91de59c and 955ca49 after the 8.3.1 release. I verified the fix works correctly by running the existing tests and a minimal reproduction script.
